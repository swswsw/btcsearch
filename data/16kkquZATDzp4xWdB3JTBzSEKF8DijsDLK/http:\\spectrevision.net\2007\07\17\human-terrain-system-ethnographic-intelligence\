<p>Montgomery McFate&#8217;s Mission<br />
Can one anthropologist possibly steer the course in Iraq?<br />
BY Matthew B. Stannard ??/ ??Sunday, April 29, 2007</p>
<p>We&#8217;re trying to do something against mealy-mouthed policies that don&#8217;t<br />
hold responsible those scum with Ph.D.&#8217;s who stand beside torturers,&#8221;<br />
Gerald Sider, a professor emeritus of anthropology at the City<br />
University of New York Graduate Center, snarled to a reporter for<br />
Inside Higher Ed.</p>
<p>Sider was interviewed in November at the 105th annual business meeting<br />
of the American Anthropological Association in San Jose. The meeting<br />
was abuzz over a year-old New Yorker article by Seymour Hersh,<br />
alleging that a 1973 book by cultural anthropologist Raphael Patai,<br />
&#8220;The Arab Mind,&#8221; might have inspired the Abu Ghraib prison abuses, on<br />
the theory that sexually humiliated Arab men would become willing<br />
informants.</p>
<p>Hundreds of anthropologists at the business meeting &#8212; the first<br />
official quorum in 30 years &#8212; unanimously endorsed a resolution<br />
condemning &#8220;the use of anthropological knowledge as an element of<br />
physical and psychological torture.&#8221;</p>
<p>But one anthropologist, while sharing her peers&#8217; condemnation of<br />
torture as immoral and ineffective, worried that some of her<br />
colleagues had the wrong response to Abu Ghraib: Don&#8217;t scold the<br />
military, she argued. Educate it.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Patai&#8217;s book had been used correctly, they would never have done<br />
that. Because they would have understood that &#8230; you&#8217;re not going to<br />
get intelligence information out of these people, you&#8217;re going to get<br />
them and their families attacking you,&#8221; she said later. &#8220;Half-baked<br />
knowledge is sometimes worse than none at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She is Montgomery McFate, a Marin County native now at the United<br />
States Institute of Peace. For five years, McFate has made it her<br />
mission to convince the U.S. military that anthropology can be a more<br />
effective weapon than artillery.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you understand how to frustrate or satisfy the population&#8217;s<br />
interests to get them to support your side in a counterinsurgency, you<br />
don&#8217;t need to kill as many of them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you certainly will<br />
create fewer enemies.&#8221;</p>
<p>That kind of kumbaya comment seems misplaced in a militaristic era of<br />
shock and awe, but so does McFate: a punk rock wild child of dyed-in-<br />
the-wool hippies, a 41-year-old with close-cropped hair and a voice<br />
buttery with sardonic amusement, a double-doc Ivy Leaguer with a<br />
penchant for big hats and American Spirit cigarettes and a nose that<br />
still bears the tiny dent of a piercing 25 years closed.</p>
<p>Her ideas have made McFate the focus of bitter criticism &#8212; but not<br />
from the uniformed forces. After four years of a war that was supposed<br />
to last more like four months, the military is now listening to<br />
McFate&#8217;s ideas &#8212; and committing money and manpower to make them a<br />
reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;By force of her intellect and personality, she&#8217;s going to shape the<br />
way this is understood,&#8221; said Kalev Sepp, a counterinsurgency expert<br />
at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. &#8220;What she reveals can&#8217;t<br />
be ignored.&#8221;</p>
<p>The criticism of McFate comes from social scientists who say McFate is<br />
following a path of good intentions toward a diabolical future where<br />
science meant to improve humanity becomes a weapon of mass<br />
destruction.</p>
<p>&#8220;If people like McFate and their vision of anthropology becomes more<br />
powerful, the discipline will really change in ways that I think would<br />
be calamitous,&#8221; said Hugh Gusterson, a professor of cultural studies<br />
at George Mason University and one of McFate&#8217;s more vocal critics. &#8220;I<br />
think she&#8217;s encouraging people to do things that I regard as<br />
unethical.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate has little patience for what she views as academic malcontents<br />
more interested in issuing resolutions than in finding solutions.<br />
After 30 years, she wants to see an anthropologist sitting on the<br />
National Security Council.</p>
<p>&#8220;The military is so willing to listen now &#8230; and for anthropologists<br />
to sit back in their ivory tower and spit at these people that are<br />
asking for their help &#8212; I think there&#8217;s something unethical about<br />
that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not in the room with them, you won&#8217;t<br />
influence their decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Montgomery McFate was born on Jan. 8, 1966 in Waldo Point, a Sausalito<br />
backwater of houseboats and hippies described by a San Francisco<br />
Examiner reporter in 1972 as &#8220;equal parts fantasy and ghetto reality.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate lived at what she calls the &#8220;art scene&#8221; of Gate 5. A childhood<br />
friend, author Cintra Wilson, calls the denizens there &#8220;practically<br />
squatters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I lived in a little bit more gentrified houseboats &#8230; we had<br />
plumbing,&#8221; said Wilson, who loosely based a character in her novel<br />
&#8220;Colors Insulting to Nature&#8221; on McFate. &#8220;But Gate 5 had resolved to<br />
not be gentrified, and there were riots where you&#8217;d have pregnant<br />
women hitting cops with boat oars, like &#8216;No, we don&#8217;t want plumbing!&#8217;<br />
&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate&#8217;s mother, Frances Pointer, bought a surplus World War II<br />
ammunition barge for a dollar, converted it into studios and married<br />
Martin Carlough, a 6-foot-8-inch former Marine who got out of the<br />
corps on a mental health discharge.</p>
<p>&#8220;He used to walk around downtown in this pink denim jacket and it<br />
said, &#8216;I am God&#8217; in giant rhinestone letters,&#8221; McFate said. &#8220;It&#8217;s my<br />
first memory of my father.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frances won custody in their 1968 divorce, despite her estranged<br />
husband claiming that as the &#8220;living incarnation of the eternal<br />
Buddha&#8221; he made a fitter parent. Hospitalized and treated with<br />
electroshock therapy, Martin ended up wandering the streets of<br />
Sausalito in the early &#8217;70s.</p>
<p>&#8220;They basically fried his brain. He was no longer a human being,&#8221;<br />
McFate recalled. &#8220;He rather flamboyantly threw himself off the Golden<br />
Gate Bridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate&#8217;s mother was comparatively stable. But her rejection of society<br />
left her with no real income other than rent from the other apartments<br />
on her barge &#8212; the white curtains in the bedroom of a Marin City<br />
friend seemed to McFate an unimaginable luxury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her advice to me when I was a kid was never write anything down,<br />
don&#8217;t leave any records, never trust the government, don&#8217;t join any<br />
organizations. She was a real anarchist,&#8221; McFate said.</p>
<p>The conflicts between the Gate 5 residents and the forces of<br />
development led to a long standoff around a pile driver near McFate&#8217;s<br />
barge. Sheriff&#8217;s deputies took up residence outside her bedroom,<br />
protecting the equipment.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made me feel really sympathetic toward the police, who I saw as<br />
people who were just trying to do their jobs as best they could,&#8221; she<br />
said. &#8220;And these (protesters) have their really legitimate viewpoint,<br />
too, which is that they want to keep the wild world wild.</p>
<p>&#8220;It made me feel like, well, there are two sides to every story.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her mother didn&#8217;t encourage academics, instead urging McFate to get<br />
ahead on her looks. McFate and Wilson ended up studying at the local<br />
bus stop. She excelled academically, but the fashionable cliques of<br />
Tamalpais High School were daunting for a young woman who would be too<br />
poor to buy a new coat until she entered graduate school. She sought<br />
her own niche.</p>
<p>&#8220;She walked in the door one time and it was all black jeans, black<br />
combat boots, tight black sweater and this big black hat with a big<br />
black veil. It was this great look &#8230; we called her &#8216;Satan&#8217;s<br />
beekeeper,&#8217; &#8221; Wilson recalled. &#8220;She was goth before anybody was goth.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the Bay Area punk scene &#8212; the Mutants, Pearl Harbor and the<br />
Explosions, the Offs &#8212; it didn&#8217;t matter if McFate had thrift store<br />
clothing and a bed on a barge. But after three boyfriends in a row<br />
died &#8212; hanging, meth, heroin &#8212; McFate escaped back into academics.</p>
<p>Hard work paid off in a slew of small scholarships and in August 1985<br />
she moved into the freshman dorms at UC Berkeley and tried to call her<br />
mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her friend called me back an hour later and said, &#8216;I have some bad<br />
news for you: She&#8217;s dead,&#8221; McFate said. Her mother had had a stroke.<br />
&#8220;I had no brothers and sisters. My father was dead. Really I had no<br />
one to turn to. &#8230; It was just me.&#8221;</p>
<p>She recovered enough to maintain a B-plus average in her first<br />
semester, develop an interest in anthropology and enroll in graduate<br />
studies at Yale with a full scholarship. But her dissertation on the<br />
Republican community in Northern Ireland puzzled other<br />
anthropologists.</p>
<p>&#8220;People said, &#8216;You really should be doing this in political science,<br />
because it&#8217;s not appropriate for an anthropology degree,&#8217; &#8221; McFate<br />
said. &#8220;And I was like, wait, you don&#8217;t think that Republican community<br />
in Northern Ireland is a culture? It seemed to me that how human<br />
beings go to war is as much a product of culture as table manners or<br />
sexual practices.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Belfast, McFate had an epiphany: The common view of the Troubles as<br />
a battle between Catholics and Protestants, or loyalists and<br />
Republicans, or even terrorists and the government, was not how the<br />
warring sides saw it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The way (Republicans) legitimate their activities is that they are an<br />
occupied country,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been occupied for 800 years by<br />
the British military.&#8221;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, McFate said, the British troops involved in<br />
counterinsurgency recognized the same narrative.</p>
<p>&#8220;They may think personally that these people are terrorists and<br />
despise them, but they understand what&#8217;s motivating it,&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;They could not have built an effective strategy in Northern Ireland<br />
as they did without having a very full understanding of their enemy &#8211;<br />
which, by the way, it took them 30 years to get.&#8221;</p>
<p>But McFate was realizing that academia &#8212; &#8220;where you read books about<br />
books and then write a book about other people&#8217;s books about books&#8221; &#8211;<br />
was not for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to do something in the world, not about the world,&#8221; she<br />
said. After receiving her anthropology doctorate in 1994, McFate<br />
jumped to Harvard Law School, where she earned her juris doctor in<br />
1997 and landed a job as a litigation associate at Baker &amp; McKenzie in<br />
San Francisco.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I got there, and they took me up to my 24th floor office on the<br />
Embarcadero and shut the door and I&#8217;m sitting there with a view of the<br />
bay and all of a sudden I just started to cry. &#8230; &#8216;This is all wrong.<br />
This is not what I should be doing. What am I doing here?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>That quest for meaning would lead McFate into the gap between two<br />
communities that had maintained a frigid divorce for 30 years:<br />
anthropology and the military.</p>
<p>Anthropology has been called &#8220;handmaiden to colonialism&#8221; &#8212; a phrase<br />
normally used to criticize the discipline, but one McFate uses to make<br />
a point of historical fact.</p>
<p>In 1902, when the American Anthropological Association was founded<br />
with an initial membership of 175, anthropology was dominated by<br />
British scientists reporting on the empire&#8217;s subjects in Africa, or<br />
Americans studying the Sioux for the Bureau of Ethnology.</p>
<p>Even then, there were those who argued for separation. In 1919, Franz<br />
Boas, dubbed &#8220;father of American anthropology,&#8221; publicly complained<br />
that colleagues had &#8220;prostituted science&#8221; by scouring Central America<br />
for German submarine bases under the guise of research and was<br />
censured by the association.</p>
<p>Boas died in 1942, when most anthropologists were helping wage World<br />
War II, studying everything from Japanese culture to the physiques of<br />
draftees. Even Margaret Mead, probably the most famous anthropologist<br />
of all time, wrote pamphlets for the Office of War Information.</p>
<p>Some later regretted their involvement in propaganda efforts; others<br />
complained that their advice to the military &#8212; such as that the<br />
Japanese could be persuaded to surrender without a large-scale attack<br />
&#8211; was ignored. Nevertheless, for many, victory was vindication.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody came out of World War II and said &#8230; that was a necessary<br />
but nasty task,&#8221; said David Price, author of the forthcoming<br />
&#8220;Weaponizing Anthropology: American Anthropologists in the Second<br />
World War.&#8221; &#8220;Anthropologists came out of World War II and said, &#8216;We<br />
can use anthropology to solve the world&#8217;s problems.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>American military mistakes in Vietnam &#8212; a belief in American virtue,<br />
listening to a few locals pushing an agenda instead of the entire<br />
culture &#8212; presaged those in Iraq, McFate said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost in Vietnam. The Joint Chiefs of Staff and the entire national<br />
security establishment decided that they would never do that again,&#8221;<br />
she said. &#8220;They decided to focus their energies on a peer competitor<br />
&#8211; the Soviets.&#8221;</p>
<p>The decision to avoid Vietnam-style counterinsurgency warfare led to<br />
the creation of large-scale, high-tech, heavily armored conventional<br />
forces that could play the Soviets to a draw and utterly overwhelm any<br />
other foe. Military training mirrored that strategy, as young officers<br />
were encouraged to pursue careers in combat leadership over more<br />
academic pursuits.</p>
<p>&#8220;If what war fighting becomes is servicing targets from hundreds or<br />
thousands of kilometers away, you don&#8217;t need cultural understanding,&#8221;<br />
said Steven Metz, professor of national security affairs at the<br />
Strategic Studies Institute of the U.S. Army War College. &#8220;(But) the<br />
people who were opposed to us, they learned from the Gulf War as<br />
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>The adversary applied its lessons of asymmetric warfare in the Sept.<br />
11 attacks, the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq, and the<br />
American military under Donald Rumsfeld faced a task unlike any it had<br />
before &#8212; and had all the wrong tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rumsfeld &#8230; was going to optimize the way the force functioned.<br />
Other cultures didn&#8217;t matter. Other societies didn&#8217;t count. Just how<br />
efficiently could you deliver firepower,&#8221; Sepp said. &#8220;(But) in Iraq,<br />
just bombing and blasting things, the people who knew that wasn&#8217;t<br />
working were the guys on the ground &#8212; the captains and sergeants &#8211;<br />
that had to make this happen. You just can&#8217;t kill enough of these<br />
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>At some point in the past 18 months, the focus in Iraq began to shift<br />
away from a military solution. Rumsfeld was replaced by Robert Gates,<br />
a former CIA director with a doctorate from Georgetown University.<br />
Operations in Iraq went to Gen. David Petraeus, a Ph.D. from<br />
Princeton, fresh from overseeing a new counterinsurgency manual that<br />
urged field commanders to consult outside experts in governance,<br />
economics and anthropology.</p>
<p>But as the military began embracing the academics it had effectively<br />
forsworn since Vietnam, there were relatively few anthropologists<br />
returning the embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anthropologists for decades were screaming at the top of their lungs,<br />
&#8216;Hey, we can help you to administer your colonial empires, we can help<br />
you to administer post-occupation Japan&#8217; &#8230; and were ignored,&#8221; said<br />
Dustin Wax, a doctoral candidate focusing on the history of<br />
anthropology at the New School for Social Research. &#8220;Now it&#8217;s a couple<br />
decades later, and they&#8217;re saying, &#8216;Well, where are you guys when we<br />
need you?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>The narrative of anthropology in the past 30 years is remarkably<br />
similar to the military&#8217;s: a new generation recoiling from Vietnam.</p>
<p>&#8220;The elders of the day had not just fought in (World War II), but used<br />
anthropology in the war. And among the anti-war forces were a whole<br />
bunch of people who fought in (Vietnam) as 18- or 19-year-olds, got<br />
the GI Bill and were in their 30s,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;So there was a<br />
generational split.&#8221;</p>
<p>The resultant friction exploded in a series of meetings of the<br />
association in the 1970s, fueled by two of the last gasps of<br />
anthropological cooperation with the military: Project Camelot and the<br />
Thai scandal.</p>
<p>Project Camelot was a 1964 Defense Department effort to identify the<br />
potential for and means of preventing internal war in Chile, where<br />
protests forced the project&#8217;s cancellation in 1965. Five years later,<br />
documents stolen from a university professor suggested that<br />
anthropologists were helping the American and Thai governments study<br />
ways to strengthen loyalty to the Thai king. Again, those involved<br />
said their goals were salutary &#8212; studying other cultures with the<br />
goal of preventing war.</p>
<p>&#8220;A less charitable way of looking at it is it was to keep regimes in<br />
power that were favorable to the United States,&#8221; Price said. &#8220;If the<br />
regime is being propped up by the military, those regimes are probably<br />
not helping the peasants, which is who the anthropologists are out<br />
studying.&#8221;</p>
<p>That, said George Mason University&#8217;s Gusterson, points to a more<br />
fundamental issue that arose in anthropology in the 1970s: the idea<br />
that cooperation with the military ran contrary to the science&#8217;s basic<br />
principles.</p>
<p>&#8220;You pitch a tent &#8230; among the people you want to understand, you<br />
live with them, you catch their diseases, you eat their horrible food,<br />
you share their joys and pains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The thought that you would<br />
cultivate those relationships of trust and intimacy and then &#8230; go to<br />
the Pentagon and say &#8216;these are the people you should kill, these are<br />
the people you shouldn&#8217;t kill,&#8217; that&#8217;s extremely problematic for<br />
people with that methodology.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some elder anthropologists, the discipline&#8217;s recoil had by the<br />
21st century led to practical irrelevance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret Mead was on &#8216;Johnny Carson&#8217; more than two dozen times,&#8221; said<br />
Felix Moos, a University of Kansas anthropologist. &#8220;Today when I ask<br />
an audience can you name one internationally or nationally known<br />
anthropologist, I meet nothing but silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>By 2005, less than 4 percent of American Anthropological Association<br />
members surveyed by the association were working for the government.<br />
The discipline also had become politically homogenous: A George Mason<br />
University survey found Democrats outnumbering Republicans in<br />
anthropology and sociology by 20 to 1 in 2004. In a largely symbolic<br />
act that year, the association rescinded the 1919 censure of Franz<br />
Boas.</p>
<p>Little wonder that when the military finally started looking for in-<br />
house anthropologists, the list of names was very short. One of them<br />
was Montgomery McFate.</p>
<p>McFate met her future husband, Sean, at Harvard in 1997. She was the<br />
daughter of West Coast hippies, he the scion of a patrician East Coast<br />
family. But they shared an interest in Taoism, and something else: She<br />
was an anthropologist interested in the military; he was a soldier<br />
seeking to study anthropology. They married in December 1997.</p>
<p>But Sean McFate found that the military took a dim view of his<br />
scholarly interests &#8212; when he sought to leave the service for<br />
studies, they sent him to Germany for a three-year tour. His new bride<br />
traded her 7-month-old law career for the life of an Army wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a nightmare for me,&#8221; Sean confided. &#8220;Her punk rock, Ivy League<br />
background was very potent, but did not prepare her for the Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>But by the end of three years, Sean said, &#8220;she spoke and understood<br />
Army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The McFates returned to Washington D.C.&#8217;s trendy Adams Morgan<br />
neighborhood. A CD collection fills their entryway &#8212; Sean&#8217;s classical<br />
collection overwhelming a small grouping of rock CDs including Nirvana<br />
and the Sex Pistols. The remainder of the flat is filled with tikis,<br />
boat lights and Montgomery&#8217;s collection of Orientalist art.</p>
<p>Despite her return to American shores, McFate found herself still<br />
grasping for purpose until one night in 2002 when she ended a long<br />
talk with her husband about their futures by scribbling a sentence on<br />
a cocktail napkin: How do I make anthropology relevant to the<br />
military?</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s one of those times where you get goose bumps all over your<br />
body,&#8221; she said. McFate set out to work her way into the national<br />
security system: to Rand, where she studied North Korean society, then<br />
to the Office of Naval Research, where in 2004 she won permission to<br />
interview American Marines back from Iraq.</p>
<p>Some younger troops were frustrated with what they saw as Iraqi<br />
culture of inshallah, God willing &#8212; failure to meet schedules,<br />
reluctance to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps. McFate saw<br />
an imposition of American cultural expectations on a culture born of<br />
survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a psychological legacy of living under a regime of fear. If<br />
you stuck your head out and tried to do something good, you would be<br />
potentially sent to prison,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Now here we come and we just<br />
knocked over their sovereign government &#8212; dictatorship or not &#8212; and<br />
we suddenly expect they&#8217;re going to behave like us. That&#8217;s a<br />
preposterous idea.&#8221;</p>
<p>But mainly, McFate found in the Iraq veterans a hunger for cultural<br />
knowledge, one the troops had fed through Google and Barnes &amp; Noble,<br />
producing improvised innovations that were sometimes remarkable, if<br />
short-lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;This young Marine captain described how he had basically got there<br />
and been told it was his job to create a judicial system. &#8230; He went<br />
on the Internet and found a copy of the 1950 Iraqi constitution. So he<br />
used their system and he used their law, so it had tremendous local<br />
legitimacy,&#8221; McFate recalled. &#8220;But he was told by the (Coalition<br />
Provisional Authority), &#8216;You&#8217;re employing Ba&#8217;athists and you have to<br />
stop now.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>In November 2004, McFate threw together a conference on &#8220;national<br />
security and adversary cultural knowledge,&#8221; the first such conference<br />
since 1962. She expected a crowd of maybe 125. More than twice that<br />
number attended.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most embarrassing thing was we discovered we wait-listed a<br />
general,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You don&#8217;t wait-list a general.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three years after her cocktail-napkin revelation, McFate received a<br />
call from a science adviser to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was the only person he could find,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The basic message<br />
was, &#8216;The war fighters say they want information about the society<br />
they are operating in. &#8230; We need an anthropologist. Can you come<br />
over here right now?&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>Corralling a colleague who had done field research in Iraq, McFate<br />
came over, and soon was visiting the Pentagon almost every day. The<br />
McFate message, as enunciated in those meetings and in a series of<br />
essays, is that cultural ignorance is behind many U.S. problems in<br />
Iraq.</p>
<p>Her oft-cited simple example was a gesture &#8212; arm straight, palm out<br />
&#8211; that means &#8220;stop&#8221; in America but &#8220;welcome&#8221; in Iraq. That difference<br />
translated into Iraqi families driving blithely toward a seemingly<br />
welcoming American soldier at checkpoints until shot as a presumed<br />
suicide bomber.</p>
<p>On a more fundamental level, McFate has argued, the entire Iraq war<br />
was a colossal failure of cultural understanding at the highest levels<br />
of the Bush administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;They assumed that the civilian apparatus of the government would<br />
remain intact after the regime was decapitated. &#8230; In fact, when the<br />
United States cut off the hydra&#8217;s Ba&#8217;thist head, power reverted to its<br />
most basic and stable form &#8212; the tribe,&#8221; she wrote. &#8220;The tribal<br />
insurgency is a direct result of our misunderstanding the Iraqi<br />
culture.&#8221;</p>
<p>In conversation, McFate takes the argument a step further, saying that<br />
had the Bush administration understood Iraqi culture, &#8220;we would never<br />
have gone to war. Not in a million years. There&#8217;s no harder case than<br />
Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>To the military &#8212; particularly to those long-lonely counterinsurgency<br />
experts moving into positions of influence as the war soured &#8212; these<br />
ideas were both obvious and revolutionary.</p>
<p>&#8220;These kinds of perspectives that McFate brought made instant sense to<br />
people who had been fighting on the ground in Iraq,&#8221; Sepp said. &#8220;They<br />
were pounding on those issues going, &#8216;Here&#8217;s somebody who understands<br />
the kind of war were fighting.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>These days, McFate is holding so many meetings that she is finding it<br />
hard to write her book, tentatively titled &#8220;Cultural Knowledge and<br />
National Security.&#8221; Her expertise has been tapped for everything from<br />
writing part of the Army&#8217;s new counterinsurgency manual to working<br />
with the Office of the Secretary of Defense to apply that manual to<br />
the current &#8220;surge&#8221; in Baghdad and evaluating the military&#8217;s cultural<br />
information needs and training programs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Department of Defense has started a program dubbed<br />
Cultural Operational Research Human Terrain System &#8212; based on an<br />
essay McFate co-authored in 2005 &#8212; to embed five-member teams of<br />
experienced military officers and civilian social scientists with<br />
operating brigades: an anthropological brain transplant.</p>
<p>Heading the program is Steve Fondacaro, a Fresno native and self-<br />
described radical who retired from the Army as a colonel after 30<br />
years in the infantry and special operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;(McFate) is my political commissar. Every time she opens her mouth I<br />
stop what I&#8217;m doing and listen very closely, and then I apply it.<br />
Because she&#8217;s always right,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Originally, Fondacaro said, the military tried to turn McFate&#8217;s ideas<br />
into a laptop-based tool. But he argued that field commanders needed<br />
human experts to explain cultural conundrums.</p>
<p>Such as why escorting home a person arrested in error, giving his<br />
family money and apologizing to his boss might sound polite, but will<br />
get the person killed as a collaborator. Or why parched villages might<br />
violently resist well-meaning efforts to dig new wells if you don&#8217;t<br />
involve the local sheikh whose political legitimacy has for centuries<br />
been based on control of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give him credit for designing the plan and informing the population<br />
of what he is going to get the Americans to do, and when the ribbon-<br />
cutting time comes, we stand in the background and he takes all the<br />
credit,&#8221; Fondacaro said. &#8220;You (now) have an incredibly powerful ally.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first team arrived in Afghanistan at the beginning of March,<br />
Fondacaro said, and another should be ready for Iraq in July &#8211;<br />
assuming he can add to the half dozen social scientists who have so<br />
far joined the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re a scientist worth your salt, and you object &#8230; to the way<br />
military operations and military thinking ruined the quality of life<br />
for the indigenous people we deal with &#8230; then the approach to<br />
solving that problem in my view is engagement and education. It&#8217;s not<br />
isolation,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not because we&#8217;re evil people, it&#8217;s because<br />
we&#8217;re stupid. And the cure for stupidity is education. And who&#8217;s going<br />
to do that education if it isn&#8217;t you, a cultural anthropologist?&#8221;</p>
<p>To McFate, early success in getting her ideas implemented by the<br />
Pentagon is a blessing. But if her work was winning her fans in the<br />
military, it was outraging some of her colleagues in anthropology.</p>
<p>In 2004, Felix Moos brought an idea to his senator, Pat Roberts, R-<br />
Kan., then chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea really was that the military desperately needs more language-<br />
and area-qualified people than they have,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It seems to me<br />
that we would do much better in the world if we had a few thousand<br />
Arabic-speaking soldiers with us at the beginning of the current<br />
conflict in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea turned into the Pat Roberts Intelligence Scholarship Program,<br />
which provided intelligence agencies with scholarship funds to recruit<br />
and train students with language and cultural skills. Moos was<br />
delighted. But the new program electrified the 2005 meeting of the<br />
association.</p>
<p>&#8220;Initial reaction &#8230; was that the AAA should weigh in against this,&#8221;<br />
said Paul Nuti, director of external, international and government<br />
relations for the American Anthropological Association. &#8220;(But) there<br />
were competing voices heard from the membership that maybe that was<br />
too hasty of a move.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of those voices &#8212; a loud one &#8212; was McFate&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;I, for one, did not know she existed. That&#8217;s been the case with a lot<br />
of these folks that are already embedded and working for national<br />
security intelligence entities,&#8221; Nuti said. &#8220;Montgomery and others<br />
have really opened up discussion on the many, many different roles and<br />
different applications of the discipline.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than take an immediate stand against PRISP, the AAA established<br />
a commission to review its ethical guidelines and the challenges<br />
anthropologists face in national security work by late 2007.</p>
<p>But at the AAA&#8217;s next business meeting in San Jose, members passed not<br />
only the resolution against the use of anthropology in torture but<br />
also one calling for an end to the U.S. presence in Iraq. If approved<br />
by the full membership in May, both will become official AAA policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The anthropologist turned military consultant Montgomery McFate &#8230;<br />
(and others) are suggesting a form of hit-man anthropology where<br />
anthropologists, working on contract to organizations that often care<br />
nothing for the welfare of our anthropological subjects, prostitute<br />
their craft by deliberately earning the trust of our subjects with the<br />
intent of betraying it,&#8221; Gusterson wrote in an essay prepared for the<br />
meeting.</p>
<p>Prostituting the science &#8212; the same charge Franz Boas levied against<br />
his spying colleagues in 1919.</p>
<p>McFate seems to relish some of the controversy &#8212; in an early<br />
conversation about criticism of her work, she urged me to call<br />
Gusterson with what seemed like impish glee.</p>
<p>But her jaw sets at some of the personal attacks in journals or<br />
anthropology blogs &#8212; not the accusations of intellectual<br />
prostitution, but claims that she is motivated by greed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like being personally attacked. I don&#8217;t mind if they attack<br />
my writing and say I&#8217;m full of crap,&#8221; she said. &#8220;(But) if I were in<br />
this for the money &#8230; I&#8217;d be a partner in a law firm making millions<br />
of dollars a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>More academic critics of McFate&#8217;s work cite, by and large, three main<br />
issues.</p>
<p>Some say her work involves a degree of secrecy that strikes them as<br />
counter-scientific, although McFate argues that secrecy can protect<br />
lives &#8212; troops&#8217; and informants&#8217; both. Others are concerned that she<br />
is placing anthropologists everywhere under suspicion of spying &#8212; a<br />
suspicion many say they encounter in any case &#8212; and effectively<br />
endorsing the military&#8217;s agenda.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American military is being used by and large from my point of<br />
view for geopolitical domination,&#8221; said Roberto Gonzalez, an associate<br />
professor of anthropology at San Jose State University who prepared<br />
the 2006 anti-torture resolution. &#8220;I think it is very problematic for<br />
anthropologists to be involved in a system of essentially domination.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wilson, the childhood friend, argues that such critics fail to<br />
understand McFate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people we grew up around labor under the idea that no war is ever<br />
OK. (McFate), having been an anthropologist, comes from the<br />
understanding that war is a human impulse that&#8217;s not going away. Like<br />
homosexuality or something that is utterly normal and has always been<br />
there &#8212; you may object to it, but there&#8217;s no point in doing so,<br />
because it&#8217;s not going away,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At its core &#8212; for her &#8212; I know it&#8217;s an altruistic mission. What she<br />
really wants is a bloodless war.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate displays little patience for such critics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Their intentional disengagement from policy process, their uninformed<br />
unwillingness to learn about what actually goes on in Washington,&#8221; she<br />
said, a tone of icy exasperation briefly replacing the normal warm<br />
amusement. &#8220;There&#8217;s a blanket condemnation without trying to<br />
understand, which strikes me as particularly un-anthropological.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the most common criticism of McFate&#8217;s work is that it conflicts<br />
with the most fundamental ethical principles of modern anthropology.</p>
<p>&#8220;She advocates that anthropologists should cultivate relationships of<br />
trust with those communities in order to advise the U.S. military<br />
apparatus how to control them,&#8221; Gusterson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want to do what McFate is suggesting, you have an obligation<br />
to tell people in the Sunni triangle, &#8216;By the way, I&#8217;m going to be<br />
going back to Alexandria and explaining all this to Robert Gates. How<br />
do you feel about that?&#8217; I can&#8217;t imagine many people in the Sunni<br />
triangle are going to talk to you then.&#8221;</p>
<p>For some anthropologists, like Moos, that argument is grossly<br />
simplistic.</p>
<p>&#8220;In World War II, to study the einsatzgruppen of the SS, would you<br />
want them to be signing statements of confidentiality?&#8221; Moos asked. &#8220;I<br />
mean, that&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Gonzalez argues that Moos&#8217; question is essentially correct &#8212; and<br />
part of the reason why anthropologists should never assist the<br />
military, save perhaps in missions adjudged humanitarian by vote of<br />
the association.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s absolutely essential to explain clearly to potential informants<br />
&#8211; whether they are Zapotec farmers or whether those are SS officers<br />
&#8211; any possible risks that the work might entail for them. &#8230; No<br />
matter how distasteful we might find what it is they do,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>McFate acknowledges the inherent tension in her work, and shares the<br />
fear of the abuse of anthropology.</p>
<p>Anthropologists, she said, need to balance &#8220;the anthropological<br />
interest in protecting informants and the national security interests<br />
of acquiring valuable information and knowledge that might potentially<br />
hurt an informant but might protect the lives of American and foreign<br />
civilians and members of the armed services.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But most anthropologists &#8230; live in a pretty simple moral world.<br />
Their only interest is the interests of their informants. That is the<br />
sine qua non of anthropology. That is the prime directive. And I live<br />
in a more complicated world where that is a directive, but it is not<br />
the prime directive. Perhaps that is what they find so objectionable.&#8221;</p>
<p>McFate seems to respect her critics &#8212; even vocal ones like Gusterson<br />
&#8211; for at least taking part in the debate over anthropology and<br />
national security.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Hugh is also doing a great service for the country. He&#8217;s a<br />
dissenter. I&#8217;m also a dissenter. We&#8217;re dissenting against different<br />
things. &#8230; I&#8217;m dissenting against anthropology right now,&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;Under different circumstances, we could have been great friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>But those anthropologists who are sitting out the issue, she said, are<br />
missing a great &#8212; and perhaps a final &#8212; opportunity to influence<br />
America&#8217;s interaction with the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have stayed in the ivory tower. It&#8217;s a safe place, it&#8217;s an easy<br />
place to be. I did a Ph.D. at Yale, so I&#8217;m very familiar with what<br />
that looks like. I&#8217;d just like to see them get out more,&#8221; she said.<br />
&#8220;They have a unique voice, and they have a lot more power and a lot<br />
more authority than they think they do.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is that concern, McFate said, that makes her evangelize her fellow<br />
anthropologists, that makes her giddy when amid the many fan letters<br />
she receives from military personnel appears the occasional note from<br />
a fellow anthropologist expressing a desire to get involved &#8212; or at<br />
least an interest in the debate.</p>
<p>Because for McFate, it is not ultimately her colleagues&#8217; criticism<br />
that worries her. It is the fear that the entire discussion is taking<br />
place too late.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Petraeus &#8230; is going over there. And he&#8217;s been given carte<br />
blanche by the White House. He can have any resource he wants,&#8221; she<br />
said that cold February day, seated on her bench across from the White<br />
House, keeping warm with a fur coat and an American Spirit, her eyes<br />
hidden behind oversize sunglasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;My fear is that &#8230; he&#8217;s going to go over there and it&#8217;s going to be<br />
too late, and he&#8217;s going to fail. And the whole thing is going to be<br />
delegitimized: the counterinsurgency doctrine, non-kinetic force,<br />
delegitimized,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;And then what&#8217;s the Army going to<br />
do? It&#8217;s going to fall back on what it had before &#8230; technology and<br />
firepower.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you can figure out how a society is wired, you don&#8217;t need to<br />
do that,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what the game is. That&#8217;s what Petraeus is<br />
going to do. But you can&#8217;t do that if you don&#8217;t have information.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Human Terrain System: A CORDS for the 21st Century</p>
<p>??????In accurately defining the contextual and cultural population of<br />
the task force battlespace, it became rapidly apparent that we needed<br />
to develop a keen understanding of demographics as well as the<br />
cultural intricacies that drive the Iraqi population.1<br />
??????- Major General Peter W. Chiarelli, Commander, 1st Cavalry<br />
Division, Baghdad, 2004-2005</p>
<p>Conducting military operations in a low-intensity conflict without<br />
ethnographic and cultural intelligence is like building a house<br />
without using your thumbs: it is a wasteful, clumsy, and unnecessarily<br />
slow process at best, with a high probability for frustration and<br />
failure. But while waste on a building site means merely loss of time<br />
and materials, waste on the battlefield means loss of life, both<br />
civilian and military, with high potential for failure having grave<br />
geopolitical consequences to the loser.</p>
<p>Despite these potential negative consequences, the U.S. military has<br />
not always made the necessary effort to understand the foreign<br />
cultures and societies in which it intended to conduct military<br />
operations. As a result, it has not always done a good job of dealing<br />
with the cultural environment within which it eventually found itself.<br />
Similarly, its units have not always done a good job in transmitting<br />
necessary local cultural information to follow-on forces attempting to<br />
conduct phase iv operations (those operations aimed at stabilizing an<br />
area of operations in the aftermath of major combat).</p>
<p>Many of the principal challenges we face in Operations Iraqi Freedom<br />
and Enduring Freedom (OIF and OEF) stem from just such initial<br />
institutional disregard for the necessity to understand the people<br />
among whom our forces operate as well as the cultural characteristics<br />
and propensities of the enemies we now fight. To help address these<br />
shortcomings in cultural knowledge and capabilities, the Foreign<br />
Military Studies Office (FMSO), a U.S. Army Training and Doctrine<br />
command (TRADOC) organization that supports the Combined Arms Center<br />
at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, is overseeing the creation of the human<br />
terrain system (HTS). This system is being specifically designed to<br />
address cultural awareness shortcomings at the operational and<br />
tactical levels by giving brigade commanders an organic capability to<br />
help understand and deal with &#8220;human terrain&#8221;-the social,<br />
ethnographic, cultural, economic, and political elements of the people<br />
among whom a force is operating.2 So that U.S. forces can operate more<br />
effectively in the human terrain in which insurgents live and<br />
function, HTS will provide deployed brigade commanders and their<br />
staffs direct social-science support in the form of ethnographic and<br />
social research, cultural information research, and social data<br />
analysis that can be employed as part of the military decisionmaking<br />
process.</p>
<p>The core building block of the system will be a five-person Human<br />
Terrain Team (HTT) that will be embedded in each forward-deployed<br />
brigade or regimental staff. The HTT will provide the commander with<br />
experienced officers, NCOs, and civilian social scientists trained and<br />
skilled in cultural data research and analysis. The specific roles and<br />
functions of HTT members and supporting organizations are discussed<br />
below.</p>
<p>To augment the brigade commander&#8217;s direct support, HTS will have<br />
reachback connectivity to a network of subject-matter experts now<br />
being assembled from throughout the department of defense, the<br />
interagency domain, and academia. This network will be managed by a<br />
centralized information-clearinghouse unit nested in FMSO. At the same<br />
time, to overcome the kinds of problems now typically encountered when<br />
in-place units attempt to transfer knowledge about their area of<br />
operations upon relief in place, HTS will provide for the complete<br />
transfer of HTT personnel together with the HTT database to the<br />
incoming commander upon transfer of authority. This will give the<br />
incoming commander and unit immediate &#8220;institutional memory&#8221; about the<br />
people and culture of its area of operations.</p>
<p>Five HTTS will deploy from Fort Leavenworth to Afghanistan and Iraq<br />
beginning in the fall of 2006 to provide proof-of-concept for the HTS.<br />
If they are successful, an HTT will eventually be assigned to each<br />
deployed brigade or regimental combat team.</p>
<p>Why We Need HTS-History</p>
<p>Cultural awareness will not necessarily always enable us to predict<br />
what the enemy and noncombatants will do, but it will help us better<br />
understand what motivates them, what is important to the host nation<br />
in which we serve, and how we can either elicit the support of the<br />
population or at least diminish their support and aid to the enemy.3 -<br />
Major General Benjamin C. Freakley, Commanding General, CJTF-76,<br />
Afghanistan, 2006</p>
<p>The many complex and unexpected issues resulting from lack of<br />
cultural knowledge have often been extraordinarily challenging for<br />
newly deployed commanders and their soldiers, especially in insurgent<br />
environments like those of OIF and OEF. To address recent challenges,<br />
many military thinkers have independently sought answers by studying<br />
practices and procedures from previous historical experiences.<br />
Consequently, the writings of T.E. Lawrence and David Galula have<br />
become standard reading for those searching for answers to the current<br />
insurgencies.4 interest has also been rekindled in the U.S. Marine<br />
Corps&#8217;s Small Wars Manual, a volume first published in 1940 that<br />
outlines doctrine the Corps developed for counterinsurgency in other<br />
eras.5 Other thinkers have reexamined the basics of more recent<br />
counterinsurgency practices, in Vietnam and elsewhere, in the search<br />
for appropriate and currently applicable counterinsurgency measures.6<br />
Still others have gone back to the lessons of British imperial and<br />
French colonial experience.7</p>
<p>What has emerged overall from these varied examinations of the<br />
historical record of insurgency is a broad consensus that civil<br />
society in Iraq and Afghanistan-as in past insurgencies-constitutes<br />
the real center of gravity. The current insurgencies in the middle<br />
east are manifestations of the unmet expectations and desires of large<br />
segments of the Iraqi and Afghani populations. Disappointed by their<br />
unrequited aspirations, the people tolerate and even support the<br />
presence of insurgents, thereby making insurgency possible. Such<br />
conclusions logically demand that past experience guide our<br />
understanding of how best to meet, in a manner that supports our own<br />
military objectives, the expectations and desires of the people at the<br />
heart of such struggles. And, to truly understand such expectations<br />
and desires, it is imperative to view them from the perspective of the<br />
cultures in which the insurgencies are being waged.</p>
<p>Learning from Vietnam</p>
<p>History has shown that insurgency is a complex form of armed struggle<br />
that can only be dealt with effectively if the counterinsurgent makes<br />
an effort to understand the conflict from its origin, through its<br />
evolutionary stages of development, down to its current situation.<br />
Most insurgent wars have been inherently political in nature, and<br />
therefore share the characteristic of having been decided by one side<br />
or the other&#8217;s ability to finally win the allegiance of the general<br />
civil population in the conflict area.</p>
<p>In contrast, however tempting it may be to advocate &#8220;draining the<br />
swamp&#8221; by force as a solution to insurgency (i.e., denying the<br />
insurgency support by uprooting or terrorizing the local population),<br />
such policies have historically only increased popular resentment,<br />
eroded popular trust, and stimulated the indigenous recruitment of<br />
additional insurgents.</p>
<p>While history offers many examples of insurgencies worthy of study,<br />
the HTS concept has been largely inspired by lessons drawn from the<br />
U.S. Experience in Vietnam. During the Vietnam conflict, U.S. Armed<br />
Forces essentially fought two different wars: one a conventional war<br />
against regular North Vietnamese formations; the other an insurgency<br />
war against guerrillas who, for a long time, moved freely throughout<br />
the area of operations because they enjoyed the support of a<br />
significant number of the rural South Vietnamese people. The record<br />
reveals that U.S. counterinsurgency efforts in the early part of the<br />
conflict were severely hobbled by a lack of understanding of, or<br />
appreciation for, Vietnamese culture, and a paucity of cultural<br />
skills, especially language ability.</p>
<p>Subsequently, among the many weapons brought to bear against the<br />
insurgency in South Vietnam during the course of the war, perhaps the<br />
most effective was one that involved South Vietnamese forces backed by<br />
advisors from the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development<br />
Support (CORDS) program, a project administered jointly by the South<br />
Vietnamese Government and the Military Assistance command, Vietnam<br />
(MACV). Implemented under the Johnson administration, the cords<br />
program specifically matched focused intelligence collection with<br />
direct action and integrated synchronized activities aimed at winning<br />
the &#8220;hearts and minds&#8221; of the South Vietnamese. CORDS was premised on<br />
a belief that the war would be ultimately won or lost not on the<br />
battlefield, but in the struggle for the loyalty of the people.8</p>
<p>With CORDS, intelligence collection and civil military operations were<br />
consolidated under a single civilian head, in order to shift the focus<br />
of military operations from defeating the North Vietnamese army and<br />
regional communist guerrillas by direct military force, to working<br />
with the South Vietnamese to gather human and cultural intelligence<br />
and to develop economic and social programs. These latter programs<br />
aimed to undermine indigenous support for the communist forces.</p>
<p>William Colby, one of the architects of this strategy, later blamed<br />
the final loss in Vietnam on failure to fully implement the cords<br />
strategy. Colby asserted that the &#8220;major error of the Americans in<br />
Vietnam was insisting upon fighting an American style military war<br />
against an enemy who, through the early years of the war, was fighting<br />
his style of people&#8217;s war at the level of the population.&#8221;9 Colby<br />
asserted that efforts to transform rural life through economic<br />
development would create the conditions necessary to foster peace and<br />
stability. Such development, he maintained, would counter any appeal<br />
the terrorists might have for the people by creating local<br />
opportunities for the people to exercise real freedoms within their<br />
own institutions and values.10</p>
<p>More recent work appears to validate Colby&#8217;s assessment. Robert K.<br />
Brigham stresses this point in a study assessing the South Vietnamese<br />
army and its linkages to its own society-the society from which the<br />
army had to draw its resources and its legitimacy.11 Colby&#8217;s views are<br />
further supported by the work of James H. Willbanks. In his recent<br />
treatment of Vietnamization, Willbanks addresses the tension between<br />
defeating the opposing regular force and pacifying the south in the<br />
final stages of that war (1968-1975). He underscores the linkage<br />
between pacification and Vietnamization, and argues that the former<br />
contributed to the overall stability of rural South Vietnam.12</p>
<p>Despite CORDS&#8217; shortcomings (the overall success of the program is<br />
still heatedly debated by historians), it is hard to argue with the<br />
statistics from that era. Where CORDS was effectively implemented,<br />
enemy activity declined sharply. In memoirs and records opened in the<br />
aftermath of the conflict, North Vietnamese leaders repeatedly express<br />
their concern about the effectiveness of the cords program in impeding<br />
both their operational and subversion campaigns.13</p>
<p>A key feature leading to the success of cords was an effective<br />
information collection and reporting system that focused on factors<br />
essential for the promotion of security, economic development,<br />
governance, and the provision of needed government services down to<br />
the hamlet level. Cultural, economic, and ethnographic reports were<br />
paralleled by monthly reports on the training, equipment, morale, and<br />
readiness of Vietnamese Armed Forces from the separate platoon level<br />
to the highest echelons.14 Though imperfect, the systematic collection<br />
of such information gave both the South Vietnamese Government and MACV<br />
sufficient situational awareness, at the granular level of detail<br />
needed, to cope effectively with many areas dominated by insurgents.<br />
The Major problem with CORDS appears to have been that it was started<br />
too late and ended too soon.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Vietnam-era cords experience provides many important<br />
lessons to guide the development of an effective cultural intelligence<br />
program, one that can support tactical-and operational-level<br />
commanders today.</p>
<p>Among the most significant deficiencies evident in the otherwise<br />
effective CORDS program was that it had limited reachback capability.<br />
This meant that cords operators had to rely mainly upon the program&#8217;s<br />
own independently developed databases and sources for information.<br />
CORDS was not structured or resourced to take full advantage of the<br />
massive U.S. capabilities for cultural and social research and<br />
analysis that would have enabled even greater effectiveness in dealing<br />
with the culturally diverse environment of Vietnam. Instead, CORDS<br />
advisory teams were left largely to their own devices to invent<br />
collection systems and methods for storing and analyzing their own<br />
data. HTS will not suffer such shortfalls in capability.</p>
<p>Why We Need HTS Today</p>
<p>in the current climate, there is broad agreement among operators and<br />
researchers that many, if not most, of the challenges we face in Iraq<br />
and Afghanistan have resulted from our failure early on to understand<br />
the cultures in which coalition forces were working. In other words,<br />
failing to heed the lessons of Vietnam and cords, we did not take the<br />
steps necessary to deal appropriately with the insurgencies within the<br />
context of their unique cultural environments. Moreover, there appears<br />
to be general agreement that whatever notable successes we have had in<br />
specific localities closely correlate with proactive efforts by<br />
coalition units to understand and respect the culture. By conducting<br />
operations that took indigenous cultural norms into account, those<br />
units garnered support for coalition objectives.</p>
<p>Yet, current intelligence systems and organizations still remain<br />
primarily structured to support commanders in physical combat. They<br />
are engineered to collect traditional elements of information like<br />
order of battle, enemy dispositions and estimated capabilities, and<br />
friendly and neutral capabilities for actual combat. Generally, such<br />
data is maintained in automated databases and arrayed on computer<br />
screens that depict enemy forces, friendly forces, communications<br />
nodes, key logistics facilities, and the like.</p>
<p>But, as the current conflicts have moved further away from combat<br />
involving regular formations and heavy maneuver warfare, and more<br />
toward insurgency operations with fragile stability operations<br />
requirements, it is now apparent that the technical information<br />
required for high-intensity conflict has diminished in importance<br />
relative to the requirement for the kind of ethnographic, economic,<br />
and cultural information needed to stabilize a polity and transfer<br />
power to an indigenous government. Irrespective, today, commanders<br />
arriving in their areas of operation are routinely left to fend for<br />
themselves in inventing their own systems and methodologies for<br />
researching and analyzing such data. Developing a system and processes<br />
requires the expenditure of enormous amounts of precious time and<br />
involves a great deal of trial and error, together with a steep<br />
learning curve. The resulting database is generally accomplished<br />
through ad hoc rearrangement of the staff. Nor are these homegrown<br />
databases formally linked to other databases to allow the seamless<br />
sharing of information or the archiving of data for broader use within<br />
the Army. Moreover, the database and institutional memory that go with<br />
it are not effectively transferred to relieving units upon<br />
redeployment. As a result, new commanders entering the area of<br />
operations usually must start again from scratch, developing their own<br />
system for researching and analyzing cultural data.</p>
<p>Consequently, it is glaringly apparent that commanders need a<br />
culturally oriented counterpart to tactical intelligence systems to<br />
provide them with a similarly detailed, similarly comprehensive<br />
cultural picture of their areas of operations.</p>
<p>HTS aims to mitigate these problems by providing commanders with a<br />
comprehensive cultural information research system that will be the<br />
analogue to traditional military intelligence systems. It will fill<br />
the cultural knowledge void by gathering ethnographic, economic, and<br />
cultural data pertaining to the battlefield and by providing the means<br />
to array it in various configurations to support analysis and<br />
decisionmaking. Moreover, the forward deployed brigade-level elements<br />
upon which the system is based will have reachback capability for<br />
research. Additionally, the whole database and institutional memory<br />
will be transferred in total to successive commanders upon unit<br />
rotation, providing for needed continuity of situational awareness.</p>
<p>A Closer Look at HTS</p>
<p>In its current conception, HTS is built upon seven components, or<br />
&#8220;pillars&#8221;: human terrain teams (HTTs), reachback research cells,<br />
subject-matter expert networks, a tool kit, techniques, human terrain<br />
information, and specialized training.</p>
<p>Each HTT will be comprised of experienced cultural advisors familiar<br />
with the area in which the commander will be operating. The actual<br />
experts on the ground, these advisors will be in direct support of a<br />
brigade commander. All will have experience in organizing and<br />
conducting ethnographic research in a specific area of responsibility,<br />
and they will work in conjunction with other social-science<br />
researchers. HTTs will be embedded in brigade combat teams, providing<br />
commanders with an organic capability to gather, process, and<br />
interpret relevant cultural data. In addition to maintaining the<br />
brigade&#8217;s cultural databases by gathering and updating data, HTTS will<br />
also conduct specific information research and analysis as tasked by<br />
the brigade commander.</p>
<p>Teams will consist of five members: a leader, a cultural analyst, a<br />
regional studies analyst, a human terrain research manager, and a<br />
human terrain analyst.</p>
<p>_ The HTT leader will be the commander&#8217;s principal human terrain<br />
advisor, responsible for supervising the team&#8217;s efforts and helping<br />
integrate data into the staff decision process. He or she will be a<br />
Major or lieutenant colonel and a staff college graduate, and will<br />
have spent time as a principal brigade staff officer.</p>
<p>_ The cultural analyst will advise the HTT and brigade staff and<br />
conduct or manage ethnographic and social-science research and<br />
analysis in the brigade&#8217;s area of operations. The analyst will be a<br />
qualified cultural anthropologist or sociologist competent with<br />
geographical imaging software and fluent enough in the local language<br />
to perform field research. Priority selection will go to those who<br />
have published, studied, lived, and taught in the region.</p>
<p>_ The regional studies analyst will have qualifications and skills<br />
similar to the cultural analyst.</p>
<p>_ The human terrain research manager will have a military background<br />
in tactical intelligence. The manager will integrate the human terrain<br />
research plan with the unit intelligence collection effort, will<br />
debrief patrols, and will interact with other agencies and<br />
organizations.</p>
<p>_ The human terrain analyst will also have a military intelligence<br />
background and be a trained debriefer. He or she will be the primary<br />
human terrain data researcher, will debrief patrols, and will interact<br />
with other agencies and organizations. The HTT will be responsible to<br />
the brigade commander for three deliverables:</p>
<p>_ A constantly updated, user-friendly ethnographic and sociocultural<br />
database of the area of operations that can provide the commander data<br />
maps showing specific ethnographic or cultural features. The HTT&#8217;s<br />
tool kit is mapping Human terrain (map-Ht) software, an automated<br />
database and presentation tool that allows teams to gather, store,<br />
manipulate, and provide cultural data from hundreds of categories.<br />
Data will cover such subjects as key regional personalities, social<br />
structures, links between clans and families, economic issues, public<br />
communications, agricultural production, and the like. The data<br />
compiled and archived will be transferred to follow-on units.<br />
Moreover, although map-Ht will be operated by the HTTs, the system<br />
will regularly transfer data to rear elements for storage in a larger<br />
archive, to allow for more advanced analysis and wider use by the<br />
military and other government agencies.</p>
<p>_ The ability to direct focused study on cultural or ethnographic<br />
issues of specific concern to the commander.</p>
<p>_ A reachback link to a central research facility in the United States<br />
that draws on government and academic sources to answer any cultural<br />
or ethnographic questions the commander or his staff might have.</p>
<p>Finally, as previously noted, the team and database will not displace<br />
when a commander or unit departs upon change of responsibility.<br />
Instead, the HTT will transfer in its entirety to the incoming<br />
commander and unit.</p>
<p>Reachback Specifics</p>
<p>To provide the reachback that CORDS lacked, an organization called the<br />
HTS reachback research Center (RRC) will be established as part of the<br />
Foreign Military Studies Office at Fort Leavenworth. All HTTS will<br />
have direct connectivity with the RRC.</p>
<p>Initially, the RRC will have 14 researchers, all experts in the<br />
cultural and ethnographic characteristics of the geographic area they<br />
support. The RRC will systematically receive information from deployed<br />
HTTs through the map-Ht system. Data will be collated, catalogued, and<br />
placed into a central database. The RRC will also be able to conduct<br />
additional analysis in support of forward HTTs.</p>
<p>The RRC&#8217;s main purpose is to help HTTs answer forward-deployed<br />
commanders&#8217; specific requests for information. Apart from its own<br />
institutional expertise, the RRC will be able to access a network of<br />
researchers throughout the government and academia to conduct research<br />
and get answers. RRC researchers will also constitute the primary pool<br />
from which replacements for forward HTTs will be drawn. RRC personnel<br />
will periodically rotate into theater to serve tours as forward HTT<br />
members. They will be designated to reinforce in-theater HTTs during<br />
an emergency or in a surge period, as required by a brigade commander.</p>
<p>Overall System</p>
<p>In addition to the capabilities the HTS offers to brigade commanders<br />
and other decisionmakers in given areas of operation, the data it<br />
compiles will be available for the training, modeling, and simulation<br />
communities to better support deploying forces in their mission<br />
rehearsal exercise scenario development. Other U.S. Government<br />
agencies will also have access to the central database. And finally,<br />
to facilitate economic development and security, the compiled<br />
databases will eventually be turned over to the new governments of<br />
Iraq and Afghanistan to enable them to more fully exercise sovereignty<br />
over their territory and to assist with economic development.</p>
<p>Getting the Data</p>
<p>Most civilian and military education is based on unclassified or open-<br />
source information derived from the social sciences. Similarly, most<br />
cultural information about populations is unclassified. To ensure that<br />
any data obtained through the HTS does not become unnecessarily<br />
fettered or made inaccessible to the large numbers of soldiers and<br />
civilians routinely involved in stability operations, the information<br />
and databases assembled by the HTS will be unclassified.</p>
<p>Many Grounds for Optimism</p>
<p>To date, although our brigades have performed with heroism and<br />
distinction in Iraq and Afghanistan, lack of cultural knowledge and<br />
language capabilities appear to have been Major common factors<br />
standing in the way of optimal success. With the introduction of the<br />
HTS and its human terrain teams, future deploying brigades will get a<br />
running start once they enter theater. They will be culturally<br />
empowered, able to key on the people and so prosecute counternotes<br />
insurgency as Lawrence, Galula, and other practitioners have<br />
prescribed-not by fire and maneuver, but by winning hearts and minds.<br />
In turn, the army, our Nation, and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan<br />
will benefit from the fielding of this powerful new instrument for<br />
conducting stability operations and reconstruction.</p>

Montgomery McFate Ph.D., J.D., and Andrea Jackson as described in<br />
their article, &#8220;an Organizational Solution for DoD&#8217;s Cultural<br />
Knowledge Needs,&#8221; Military Review (July-august 2005): 1821. Most of<br />
the practical work to implement the concept under the title Human<br />
terrain System was done by Cpt Don Smith, U.S. Army reserve, of the<br />
Foreign Military Studies Office, between July 2005 and August 2006.<br />
Under this concept, &#8220;human terrain&#8221; can be defined as the human<br />
population and society in the operational environment (area of<br />
operations) as defined and characterized by sociocultural,<br />
anthropologic, and ethnographic data and other non-geophysical<br />
information about that human population and society. Human terrain<br />
information is open-source derived, unclassified, referenced<br />
(geospatially, relationally, and temporally) information. It includes<br />
the situational roles, goals, relationships, and rules of behavior of<br />
an operationally relevant group or individual.</p>

<p>Networds: Terra Incognita and the Case for Ethnographic Intelligence</p>
<p>??????Author&#8217;s note: What I have chosen to call &#8220;ethnographic<br />
intelligence&#8221; might be more accurately described as &#8220;ethnographic<br />
information,&#8221; since much of the content involved in analyzing a<br />
hostile network will be open source. I have chosen to retain<br />
&#8220;Intelligence,&#8221; however, to indicate the military utility of the<br />
content involved.</p>
<p>The proliferation of empowered networks makes &#8220;ethnographic<br />
intelligence&#8221; (EI) more important to the United States than ever<br />
before.2 Among networks, al-Qaeda is of course the most infamous, but<br />
there are several other examples from the recent past and present,<br />
such as blood-diamond and drug cartels, that lead to the conclusion<br />
that such networks will be a challenge in the foreseeable future.<br />
Given the access these networks have to expanded modern communications<br />
and transportation and, potentially, to weapons of mass destruction,<br />
they are likely to be more formidable than any adversaries we have<br />
ever faced.</p>
<p>Regrettably, the traditional structure of the U.S. military<br />
intelligence community and the kind of intelligence it produces aren&#8217;t<br />
helping us counter this threat. As recent debate, especially in the<br />
services, attests, there is an increased demand for cultural<br />
intelligence. Retired army Major General Robert Scales has highlighted<br />
the need for what he calls cultural awareness in Iraq: &#8220;I asked a<br />
returning commander from the 3rd Infantry Division how well<br />
situational awareness (read aerial and ground intelligence technology)<br />
worked during the march to Baghdad. &#8216;I knew where every enemy tank was<br />
dug in on the outskirts of Tallil,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;Only problem was, my<br />
soldiers had to fight fanatics charging on foot or in pickups and<br />
firing AK-47s and [rocket propelled grenades]. I had perfect<br />
situational awareness. What i lacked was cultural awareness. Great<br />
technical intelligence&#8230;wrong enemy.&#8217;&#8221;3</p>
<p>I propose that we go beyond even General Scales&#8217;s plea for cultural<br />
awareness and look instead at amassing EI, the type of intelligence<br />
that is key to setting policy for terra incognita. The terra in this<br />
case is the human terrain, about which too often too little is known<br />
by those who wield the instruments of national power. The United<br />
States needs EI to combat networks and conduct global<br />
counterinsurgency. This paper will therefore define EI, discuss some<br />
cases that illustrate the requirement for it, and propose a means to<br />
acquire and process it.</p>
<p>EI Defined</p>
<p>According to Dr. Anna Simons of the United States naval postgraduate<br />
School, &#8220;What we mean by EI is information about indigenous forms of<br />
association, local means of organization, and traditional methods of<br />
mobilization.</p>
<p>Clans, tribes, secret societies, the hawala system, religious<br />
brotherhoods, all represent indigenous or latent forms of social<br />
organization available to our adversaries throughout the non-Western,<br />
and increasingly the Western, world. These create networks that are<br />
invisible to us unless we are specifically looking for them; they come<br />
in forms with which we are not culturally familiar; and they are<br />
impossible to &#8216;see&#8217; or monitor, let alone map, without consistent<br />
attention and the right training.&#8221;4</p>
<p>Because EI is the only way to truly know a society, it is the best<br />
tool to divine the intentions of a society&#8217;s members. The &#8220;Indigenous<br />
forms of association and local means of organization&#8221; are hardly alien<br />
concepts to us. Our own culture has developed what we call &#8220;social<br />
network analysis&#8221; to map these associations and forms of organization.<br />
5 These unwritten rules and invisible (to us) connections between<br />
people form key elements of the kind of information that, according to<br />
General Scales, combat commanders are now demanding. Because these<br />
rules and connections form the &#8220;traditional methods of mobilization&#8221;<br />
used either to drum up support for or opposition to U.S. goals, they<br />
demand constant attention from the U.S. government and armed forces.6<br />
Simply put, EI constitutes the descriptions of a society that allow us<br />
to make sense of personal interactions, to trace the connections<br />
between people, to determine what is important to people, and to<br />
anticipate how they could react to certain events. With the United<br />
States no longer facing a relatively simple, monolithic enemy, our<br />
national interests are found in a confusing cauldron of different<br />
locales and societies. Each of these has its own &#8220;latent forms of<br />
social organization&#8221; that create networks we cannot see or map, and to<br />
which we may very well fall victim, unless we aggressively pursue EI.7</p>
<p>The Threat: Three Case Studies</p>
<p>American national interests are affected by many societies about which<br />
we may know very little. In the early 1960s, few Americans recognized<br />
the importance of the terra incognita of Vietnamese society.8 In the<br />
1990s, America either failed to develop, or failed to employ EI on al-<br />
Qaeda, afghanistan, or Iraq.9 Today, we have little insight into which<br />
cultures or networks may soon become threats to our national<br />
interests. For this reason, America must seek to understand and<br />
develop EI on a global scale, before it is surprised by another<br />
unknown or dimly understood society or network. As a first step toward<br />
becoming more EI-smart, we might look at three illustrative cases: the<br />
blood-diamond cartel, drug trafficking syndicates, and Al-Qaeda.</p>
<p>The blood-diamond cartel. West Africa&#8217;s blood-diamond cartel is a good<br />
example of the seemingly random mixture of networks, private armies,<br />
governments of questionable legitimacy, and social environments in<br />
conflict that plague the world today. At the core of the cartel are<br />
guerrillas in Sierra Leone who have used terror tactics to control<br />
access to diamond mines. They were assisted by the former government<br />
of Charles Taylor in Liberia, which helped launder the diamonds in<br />
Europe for money. Some of that money then went to international arms<br />
dealers who smuggled weapons to the guerrillas, and some went to<br />
finance international terrorists like al-Qaeda. War, as the U.S.<br />
military has traditionally preferred to consider it-the clash of state<br />
armies and navies-has given way to a mix of crime, money, and terror<br />
executed by dark networks in league with each other and with<br />
reprehensible governments to secure profits and export terrorism.<br />
According to H. Brinton Milward and Jorg Raab, &#8220;Covert networks have<br />
come together with warlords controlling access to resources to create<br />
commodity wars. These wars are fought over control of diamonds,<br />
petroleum concessions, coca leaves, and poppies that yield narcotics,<br />
not for any real ideological or political reason.&#8221;10</p>
<p>While entities like the blood-diamond cartel have heretofore not been<br />
deemed threatening to vital U.S. interests, and thus have not<br />
justified the attention of significant American assets or numbers of<br />
troops, such a presumption is overdue for reconsideration. The United<br />
States cannot afford-nor should it be inclined to act-as the world&#8217;s<br />
policeman, but these unholy alliances now demand scrutiny. This is<br />
where EI enters the picture. When crime, brutality, poor governance,<br />
and terrorist financing come together, they are so enmeshed in the<br />
local social environment that only a detailed understanding of<br />
ethnographic factors can provide the basis for further identification<br />
of who and what truly threaten U.S. national interests. An<br />
understanding of the societies in which these networks roost is the<br />
indispensable bedrock upon which any further analysis rests.</p>
<p>Traditional military intelligence, in examining opposing formations<br />
and weapons systems, does not even speak in the same terms as those<br />
found in the blood-diamond &#8220;conflict.&#8221; In Milward and Raab&#8217;s words:<br />
&#8220;In the period after Taylor became president, the republic of Liberia<br />
became a nexus for many dark networks. There are linkages between<br />
various dark networks; some are more central than others are and some<br />
only loosely linked with the others.&#8221;11 Borrowed from social network<br />
analysis, terms like &#8220;network,&#8221; &#8220;nexus,&#8221; and &#8220;centrality&#8221; are useful<br />
concepts that allow analysts to better identify threats to American<br />
security.12</p>
<p>It is only through extensive, on-the-ground observation that latent<br />
forms of social organization and mobilization can be made apparent.<br />
When those indigenous forms of social organization are exploited by<br />
people like Charles Taylor, or become linked to external nodes such as<br />
other networks, then EI feeds and blurs into the police style social<br />
network analysis needed to identify and counter threats to U.S.<br />
interests. In this way, EI takes the incognita out of the human terra<br />
so that the United States can craft effective, realistic policy<br />
actions.</p>
<p>Drug trafficking syndicates. Drug syndicates or cartels are another<br />
networked threat that will not disappear in the foreseeable future and<br />
that cannot be depicted effectively by order-of-battle-style<br />
intelligence. Phil Williams has clearly articulated the ethnic<br />
qualities that make drug trafficking a particularly opaque threat:<br />
&#8220;[M]any networks have two characteristics that make them hard to<br />
penetrate: ethnicity and language. Moreover, many of the networks use<br />
languages or dialects unfamiliar to law enforcement personnel in the<br />
host countries. Consequently, electronic surveillance efforts directed<br />
against, for example, Chinese or Nigerian drug-trafficking networks do<br />
not exist in a vacuum, but instead operate in and from ethnic<br />
communities that provide concealment and protections as well as an<br />
important source of new recruits. Some networks, such as Chinese drug-<br />
trafficking groups, are based largely on ethnicity. They are global in<br />
scope and operate according to the principle of guanxi (notions of<br />
reciprocal obligation), which can span generations and continents and<br />
provides a basis for trust and cooperation. Such networks are<br />
especially difficult for law enforcement to infiltrate. In short, drug-<br />
trafficking networks have a significant capacity to protect their<br />
information and to defend themselves against law enforcement<br />
initiatives.&#8221;13</p>
<p>By themselves, drug gangs might not represent a clear and present<br />
danger to America, but they warrant study for two reasons. First, they<br />
are increasingly moving beyond mere profit-making ventures into<br />
alliances with other types of networks, such as the gun-runner and<br />
terrorist networks active in West Africa, that do pose a significant<br />
threat to the United States. Second, drug-trafficking networks provide<br />
a relevant example of how subversive groups can exploit ethnic social<br />
bonds and indigenous forms of mobilization about which we Westerners<br />
remain ignorant. Phil Williams&#8217; illustrative invocation of guanxi,<br />
which won&#8217;t appear in any traditional military intelligence summary,<br />
is instructive here.</p>
<p>A concept of mutual obligation that can endure from generation to<br />
generation and across great distances, guanxi can be a powerful tool<br />
in the hands of a network with evil intent. Drug trafficking can be<br />
harmful enough to a society, but when it is lashed together with the<br />
trafficking of weapons, money, and perhaps even materials of mass<br />
destruction, such racketeering does become a clear and present danger<br />
to America. A nexus of dark networks, peddling destruction in various<br />
forms, and facilitating international terrorism, becomes inordinately<br />
threatening when powered by traditional social practices such as<br />
guanxi that are invisible to states that don&#8217;t do their ethnographic<br />
homework. Williams appropriately notes that these practices, or means<br />
of &#8220;Indigenous mobilization,&#8221; work precisely because they are embedded<br />
in an ethnic population. This is true whether the population in<br />
question inhabits an ethnic enclave in a culturally dissimilar host<br />
nation or occupies its home region. In fact, under the latter<br />
conditions, local forms of organization and means of association can<br />
become more powerful than any written law, and therefore that much<br />
more efficacious for the network using them. They can be<br />
extraordinarily effective at creating local networks. However, he who<br />
has done his ethnographic analysis stands a decent chance of<br />
neutralizing the hostile actions of a dark network or perhaps even<br />
turning the activities of the network to advantage.</p>
<p>Al-Qaeda. A third case that illustrates the need for EI is Al-Qaeda.<br />
In 2004, Marc Sageman wrote Understanding Terror Networks to clarify<br />
what he saw as a widespread misperception in the West about who joins<br />
these networks and why they join.</p>
<p>Sageman concentrates on al-Qaeda&#8217;s sub-network constituents, mapping<br />
the individual networks and partially filling in their foci, such as<br />
certain mosques.14 Sageman obtained his information by accessing<br />
documents via friendly means, but he freely admits that his<br />
examination is limited. Sageman&#8217;s main agenda is to refute the myth<br />
that terrorists such as those in al-Qaeda are irrational psychopaths<br />
created by brainwashing impoverished Muslim youths. He contends that<br />
the majority of terrorists are educated, generally middle-class,<br />
mature adults. They are usually married, and they come from caring<br />
families with strong values. They are also believers wholly committed<br />
to the greater cause of global Salafist jihad.</p>
<p>According to Sageman, these people belong to four general groups in<br />
the al-Qaeda network: the Central Staff, the Southeast Asians, the<br />
Maghreb Arabs, and the Core Arabs. The Central Staff is comprised<br />
mainly of Osama bin Laden&#8217;s older compatriots, men who heard the call<br />
to jihad against the Soviet infidels in Afghanistan and who continue<br />
the fight today. The Southeast Asians are mostly disciples of two<br />
particular religious schools. The Maghreb Arabs are first- or second-<br />
generation Arabs in France. Socially isolated, the Maghrebs have<br />
sought community ties in local mosques. The Core Arabs grew up in<br />
communal societies in Islamic lands, but became isolated and lonely as<br />
they moved away to schools or jobs.</p>
<p>With the exception of some Maghreb Arabs, many of al-Qaeda&#8217;s recruits<br />
have a good education and strong job skills; they have no criminal<br />
background. Sageman writes at some length about the feeling of<br />
isolation that led many of the expatriate al-Qaeda members to seek out<br />
cliques of their own kind, and about the gradual strengthening of<br />
their religious beliefs prior to joining the jihad as a source of<br />
identity and community. He emphasizes that people join in small<br />
cliques, and that the motivation is primarily fellowship, and only<br />
later, worship. The cliques are not recruited as much as they seek out<br />
membership in al-Qaeda. In the search for fellowship, some men<br />
happened upon one of the relatively few radical mosques or became<br />
embedded in a clique that happened to have an acquaintance in the<br />
jihadist network. Sageman debunks the theory that al-Qaeda has<br />
recruiters in every mosque, yet he does point out the existence of a<br />
few people who know how to contact the larger group and will provide<br />
directions, travel money, and introductions to clandestine training<br />
camps. In sum, Sageman argues convincingly that our stereotypes of al-<br />
Qaeda are dangerously misleading.</p>
<p>Sageman&#8217;s analysis of the al-Qaeda network has been widely quoted, yet<br />
he himself underscores the lack of available first-hand information<br />
and makes it plain that he used open-source documents, with some<br />
limited personal exposure; in other words, he wrote the book without<br />
much access to EI.15 Let us imagine what Sageman&#8217;s sharp intellect<br />
would have found if he had had access to a full, well-organized range<br />
of EI from each of the four subgroups&#8217; regions. What might a dedicated<br />
core of EI specialists have discovered about the recruitment pattern?<br />
As an illustration, Sageman uncovered a key ethnographic point in the<br />
bond between student and teacher in Southeast Asia.16 The active<br />
exploration of this key example of &#8220;Indigenous forms of association&#8221;<br />
might have led to the two radical Southeast Asian schools much sooner.<br />
Perhaps armed with such knowledge, the governments in question could<br />
have taken more steps against the network years ago.</p>
<p>Acquiring and Processing EI</p>
<p>To acquire ethnographic knowledge, there is no substitute for being on<br />
the scene. For the U.S. military, the structural solution to EI could<br />
be relatively easy. Some form of U.S. Military Group, or the military<br />
annex to the embassy, could become the vehicle to collect EI. While<br />
the defense attach?? system is charged with overtly collecting military<br />
information and assessing the military situation in particular<br />
countries, there currently is no comprehensive effort to collect and<br />
process EI. The security assistance officers attached to U.S. country<br />
teams often obtain a fine appreciation of the cultural aspects of<br />
their host nation, but they are not charged with the responsibility to<br />
collect EI and may not always have a smooth relationship with the<br />
defense attach?? (if one is even assigned).17</p>
<p>There is a relatively low-cost way to set up a system to collect EI.<br />
The United States could develop a corps of personnel dedicated to the<br />
task and base them out of a more robust military annex to our<br />
embassies. There are two key points to developing such a corps: it<br />
must be devoted exclusively to the task without distraction, and its<br />
personnel must be allowed to spend extended time in country and then<br />
be rewarded for doing so.18 their work could be considered a form of<br />
strategic reconnaissance, and in reconnaissance matters there is<br />
simply no substitute for being physically present on the ground. Since<br />
the ethnographic ground in question is actually a population and not<br />
necessarily terrain, a constant and near-total immersion in the local<br />
population would be the means to turn McNamara&#8217;s terra incognita into<br />
a known set of &#8220;Indigenous forms of association, local means of<br />
organization, and traditional methods of mobilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the most streamlined EI organization would probably combine the<br />
functions of the defense attach?? and security assistance officer, such<br />
a move is not absolutely necessary.19 The most important structural<br />
aspect is that the EI developed in country should be analyzed at the<br />
embassy, forwarded to the staff of the geographic combatant commander,<br />
and shared laterally with other relevant embassies. This kind of<br />
information sharing would make for better contingency plans, and it<br />
would create a hybrid network to counter the dark networks that profit<br />
from blood diamonds, drugs, and terror.</p>
<p>A small number of Americans, usually military foreign area officers<br />
(FAOs), are already in tune with this type of work, and some have<br />
achieved a high level of excellence. There are not many of them,<br />
though, and they are not organized into a truly comprehensive system<br />
focused on the ethnographic aspects of networks. A sterling example of<br />
the capacity that the United States could build can be found in an<br />
officer named &#8220;David.&#8221; On a mission with a platoon of army rangers in<br />
western Iraq to find out how foreign fighters were infiltrating the<br />
country, David traveled in Mufti. At one village, he &#8220;met a woman with<br />
facial tattoos that marked her as her husband&#8217;s property. As they<br />
chatted, the pale-skinned, sandy-haired North Carolina native imitated<br />
her dry, throaty way of speaking. &#8216;You are Bedu, too,&#8217; she exclaimed<br />
with delight.&#8221; from her and the other Bedouins, David finds out that<br />
the foreign fighters are using local smuggling routes &#8220;to move people,<br />
guns, and money. Many of the paths were marked with small piles of<br />
bleached rocks that were identical to those David had seen a year<br />
earlier while serving in Yemen.&#8221;20</p>
<p>David gained access and operational information by using ethnographic<br />
knowledge. The deeper that personnel like David dig into local<br />
society, the better their ability to assess which groups threaten the<br />
United States and which should be left alone. If America could build a<br />
healthy corps of people like David, based out of each U.S. embassy in<br />
the world, then our nation could identify those networks that, in<br />
Simons&#8217;s formulation, are &#8220;Invisible to us unless we are specifically<br />
looking for them; [and that] come in forms with which we are not<br />
culturally familiar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sadly, there aren&#8217;t nearly enough Davids in the military. The army has<br />
about 1,000 FAOs, but most of them are in Europe. A mere 145 are<br />
focused on the Middle east, and even that number can be deceptive<br />
because a FAO&#8217;s duties include many things that aren&#8217;t related to EI,<br />
such as protocol for visits and administrative duties.21 Certainly,<br />
one solution to the growing threats from networks would be to produce<br />
more Davids and reward them for extensive time on the ground<br />
exclusively focused on the development of EI.</p>
<p>The benefits to be derived from such a corps would be tremendous.<br />
Consider, for example, the impact good EI could have had on the war<br />
plan for Iraq. There has been much discussion of late about how<br />
American forces did not really understand the Iraq&#8217;s tribal networks,<br />
a failure that contributed to the difficulties we are currently<br />
facing. With the &#8220;consistent attention and the right training&#8221; Simons<br />
has prescribed, knowledge like this could have been built into<br />
contingency plans and then updated in the regular two-year plan review<br />
cycle to insure currency. Ethnographic understanding could have<br />
allowed U.S. forces in Iraq to use tribal networks to advantage from<br />
the outset; they would not have had to figure things out for<br />
themselves, as Lieutenant Colonel Tim Ryan did: &#8220;the key is a truce<br />
brokered by the national league of Sheiks and tribal leaders and U.S.<br />
Army Lt. Col. Tim Ryan, the 1st Cavalry Division officer responsible<br />
for Abu Ghraib-a Sunni triangle town west of Baghdad and a hotbed of<br />
the insurgency. Under the agreement, Ryan now meets regularly with<br />
tribal leaders and provides them with lists of residents suspected of<br />
taking part in attacks. The sheiks and their subordinate local clan<br />
leaders then promise to keep their kinsmen in line. &#8216;They [the sheiks]<br />
do have a lot of influence. To ignore that is to ignore 6,000 years of<br />
the way business has been done here.&#8221;22</p>
<p>EI that might lead to beneficial relations with local power figures,<br />
along the lines of the one between Ryan and the sheiks, could be<br />
developed from each U.S. embassy around the clock in peacetime to<br />
inform contingency plans and enable activity against the dark networks<br />
that seek to harm America. In some places, such as pre-war Iraq or in<br />
outright killing fields similar to a blood-diamond zone, Washington<br />
will judge the presence of an embassy to be too dangerous, but in the<br />
absence of an on-site embassy, personnel can be invested in the<br />
surrounding embassies to glean as much EI as possible through borders<br />
that are often porous.</p>
<p>The Broken Windows theory of criminologists James Q. Wilson and George<br />
Kelling suggests that we might reap another benefit from establishing<br />
an American ethnographic counter-network in surrounding, linked<br />
embassies.23 the essence of the theory is that if a building has a<br />
broken window that remains unfixed, then people will assume that no<br />
one is in charge or cares; as a result, they will do whatever they<br />
wish to the place-the broken window will invite vandalism, graffiti,<br />
and so on. Once these acts of disorder commence, crime becomes<br />
contagious, like a fashion trend or virus. A more robust military<br />
annex to an embassy and a low-key, constant interest in overt<br />
ethnographic matters would show that the United States cares and is<br />
indeed watching. Perhaps this constant attention would serve to subtly<br />
constrict the amount of safehaven space available for dark networks.<br />
The overt information gathered by military ethnographers could<br />
complement the covert work done by the Cia (and vice versa).</p>
<p>U.S. citizens, at least intuitively, have always recognized the<br />
presence of networks in society, from family ties to economic<br />
relationships, indeed, to the very structure of daily life. The law<br />
enforcement community has long since recognized and acted against<br />
domestic criminal and extremist variants of these networks. However,<br />
the U.S. Government and military have had a difficult time coming to<br />
grips with networks like al-Qaeda. It took the shock of the September<br />
11th attacks to galvanize national attention on terrorist networks,<br />
and the ensuing years of struggle to grasp that terror networks can be<br />
more than ideologically motivated, and that they can flourish in the<br />
nexus of crime, drugs, weapons trafficking, money laundering, and a<br />
host of other lethal activities.</p>
<p>Terrorism can take many guises, and it blends very well into the<br />
cauldron of dark phenomena like blood diamonds, drug trafficking<br />
networks, and al-Qaeda. The United States desperately needs a counter-<br />
network to fight the dark networks now surfacing across the globe.<br />
Ethnographic intelligence can empower the daily fight against dark<br />
networks, and it can help formulate contingency plans that are based<br />
on a truly accurate portrayal of the most essential terrain-the human<br />
mind. United States policymakers must not commit us ever again to<br />
terra incognita. The nation must invest in specialized people who can<br />
pay &#8220;constant attention&#8221; to &#8220;Indigenous forms of association and<br />
mobilization,&#8221; so that we can see and map the human terrain.</p>
